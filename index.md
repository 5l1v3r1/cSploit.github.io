# cSploit

The most complete and advanced IT security professional toolkit on Android.

### like a phoenix

dSploit is an android penetration test suite for android. tux-mind contributed to it from summer '12 to autumn '14.
on autumn '14 evisocket, the owner of dSploit, choose to merge it into zANTI2, a closed source application developed by zImpremium.

dSploit will oficially merge into zANTI2, so i were forced to change the project name and forking it.

this is where cSploit born.

### cSploit target

my final goal is to write an application that can:

  - crack wifi
  - enumerate hosts (*)
  - find vulnerabilities (*)
  - find exploits for that vulnerabilities (*)
  - use thos exploits to gain access to the targets (*)
  - install backdoors for later access

(*) already working

### portability

thanks to the new core, cSploit will be high portable.

it can run on every UNIX-based system, but for now only andorid is supported, when i reach a beta-state version i will consider working on iOS, OSX, GTK+ and QT.
