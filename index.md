# cSploit

The most complete and advanced IT security professional toolkit on Android.

### cSploit target

my final goal is to write an application that can:

  - crack wifi
  - enumerate hosts (*)
  - find vulnerabilities (*)
  - find exploits for that vulnerabilities (*)
  - use thos exploits to gain access to the targets (*)
  - install backdoors for later access

(*) already working

### portability

thanks to the new core, cSploit will be high portable.

it can run on every UNIX-based system, but for now only andorid is supported, when i reach a beta-state version i will consider working on iOS, OSX, GTK+ and QT.

### story

i started working on dSploit in summer 2012, i forked it and added the following features:

  - vulnerability finder
  - exploit finder
  - MetaSploitFramework integration ( draft )

after some weeks the project owner ( evilsocket ) asked me to merge it to the upstream branch.
initially we were about 2 main developers ( me and evilsocket ) and an UI developer ( androguide ).
after a few months evilsocket get overloaded by work and stop working on it.


but i kept working on dSploit, always trying to improve it.
many function were slow and error-prone, i changed the way them work, added new features and correct many bugs.


finally, in summer 2014 i suggested a new way to make dSploit work, the new core.
basically i wish to move all the slow and inefficent code out of Java.
evilsocket agree with my suggestion and told me to start working on it.
evilsocket were very busy with work because he started working for zImpremium.


on autumn 2014 evilsocket received the order to merge dSploit into zANTI2.
this decision killed the project.
i asked if i could bring it on, but evilsocket told that the domain dsploit.net belongs to him 
and dsploit will oficially merge into zANTI2.
so i forked the project and finished my work on the new core.

> **NOTE:** evilsocket told that, in a far future, zANTI2 will be open source,
> but i cannot wait this, i want to bring on all dSploit TODO's.

this is where cSploit born.
