##### **The main goal of this crowdfunding is to purchase a small set of stuff to help the development.**


<b>&bull;</b> A new Thinkpad laptop with a good battery and memory<br>
<b>&bull;</b> A set of common WiFi adapters<br>
<b>&bull;</b> Some bluetooth adapter to add bluetooth hacking feature<br>
<b>&bull;</b> Some OTG adapters for pentestng over Ethernet and USB<br>
<b>&bull;</b> An old used iPhone<br>
<b>&bull;</b> cSploit.org DNS record<br>

As now I’m using a Thinkpad T60, purchased by a kindness guy of you.<br>
Sadly the battery life it’s about 30 minutes ( even if I purchased the biggest one ).<br>
Also using heavy development tools require a lot of memory, as now 3GB of memory isn’t enough.<br>

Thanks for your help!
