# Documentation

welcome to the offcial cSploit documents page.

## Current project status

we are in a delicate first phase of this project, we are not stable. we are moving parts of code into the new core.
even if you see __release__ this does not mean that it has no bugs.
my apologies for that, i'm doing my best for achieve a stable app :v:.

## Errors means

a short error message it's often self-explicative, but sometime what went wrong is too long to explain it in a short message.
here you can find a description for some common errors.

  - _cannot start process_: this message is printed when the core of cSploit cannot start the required process.
  - _`cmd` returned #`number`_: this message is printed when `cmd` has exited with an error code `number`
  - _`cmd` killed by signal `number`_: this message is printed when `cmd` has been killed by signal `number`

the above errors are bugs, specific for your device. so please report it if no one has already did it.

## Reporting bugs

i'm human, thus i can fail. this is why we need a good issue tracker as the one provided by github.
i'm working on an automated way to reporting bugs, directly from the app, just by clicking on a button.

until that day you have to manually collect your logcat and share it on the [github issues page](https://github.com/cSploit/android/issues).
