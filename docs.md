Welcome to the offcial cSploit documentations page.

#### Current project status

We are in a delicate first phase of this project and we are not stable, yet. Currently we are moving many parts of the code into a new core.
Even if you see a release marked as __release__, this does not mean that it has no bugs.
My apologies for that, I'm doing my best to achieve a stable app :v:.

#### Possible error

A short error message isn't often self-explanatory. Sometimes it too difficult to explain an issue with a short message and here you can find a few common examples that explain some errors:

  - - cannot start process: this message is printed when the core of cSploit cannot start the required process.
  - - **cmd** returned **#number**: this message is printed when **cmd** has exited with an error code **number**
  - - **cmd** killed by signal **number**: this message is printed when **cmd** has been killed by signal **number**

The errors above are bugs that are specific for your device. Hence, please report them if no one already did.

#### Reporting bugs

I'm human, thus I can fail. This is why we need a good issue tracker like the one provided by github.
I'm working on an automated way of reporting bugs directly from the app just by clicking on a button. Until then you have to manually collect your logcat and share it on the [github issues page](https://github.com/cSploit/android/issues).

#### FAQ

##### Is cSploit the same as dSploit ?

The basic code is the same but I'm continuing the development since dSploit has been oficcially merged into zANTI2.

##### When will feature XYZ implemented or bug ABC fixed?

Like on every other open source project - don't ask for ETA :grin:

##### How can I contribute to cSploit ?

There are many ways to contribute: by [donating](http://www.csploit.org/donate.html), by improving the source code or by correcting my English on this website.
