# Documentation

Welcome to the offcial cSploit documentations page.

## Current project status

We are in a delicate first phase of this project and we are not stable, yet. Currently we are moving many parts of the code into a new core.
Even if you see a release marked as __release__, this does not mean that it has no bugs.
My apologies for that, I'm doing my best to achieve a stable app :v:.

## Possible error sdsd 

A short error message it's often self-explanatory. Sometimes it too difficult to explain an issue with a short message and here you can find a few common exmaples that explain some errors:

  - _cannot start process_: this message is printed when the core of cSploit cannot start the required process.
  - _`cmd` returned #`number`_: this message is printed when `cmd` has exited with an error code `number`
  - _`cmd` killed by signal `number`_: this message is printed when `cmd` has been killed by signal `number`

The above errors are bugs that are specific for your device. Hence please report them if no one already did.

## Reporting bugs

I'm human, thus i can fail. This is why we need a good issue tracker like the one provided by github.
I'm working on an automated way of reporting bugs directly from the app just by clicking on a button. Until then you have to manually collect your logcat and share it on the [github issues page](https://github.com/cSploit/android/issues).
