## New toys for new software

I'm going to purchase some new toys to develop new software:

  - A T510 notebook
  - A Nexus 5X
  - An OTG type-C adapter

### T510 notebook

It comes from a kindness guy ( with much :heart: ),
I just payed the shipment cost.
I already received it and I'm configuring it to work with.

This awesome guy also sent me another ( mostly broken ) T510 to use as replacement parts source.

This is great since the fingerprint does not work and I'll going to replace it.

I really have to meet this guy to thank him !

This notebook it's great and has nothing to do with my old T60,
I can have 2 windows of my IDE with chromium and telegram and no slowdown!

I'm going to purchase RAM and an SSD to work even better,
as I saw that it's swapping a while ( it's 4GB RAM now )
and using an SSD really change everything!

### Nexus 5X

That's a sad story after all.
My Nexus 4 fall and break the glass and digitalizer.

Repair it has a cost around 150€, purchasing a Nexus 5X is 280€.

There is a reason why I'm not working on cSploit in these months: work.

So i purchase a Nexus 5X, as now I have some cash :blush:

### OTG adapter

I'm just making an order to get my new SSD and RAM, why I should not take also an OTG adapter ?

it's about an year that I have to buy one, but cSploit donations let me purchase my mobile plan at most.

As I said, now I have some cash and I'll be happy to spend them for this project :blush:

## Conslusions

Now I can work *really better* when I'm not at home!
This means that I can work on cSploit while travelling to school
or in my little breaks between lessons :sunglasses:
