#### cSploit 2 Update

We are reaching an alpha state of the web app. After that we can start
working on a mobile client ( both Android and iOS ) which talk
with the cSploit server ( say your raspberry pi ).

Next step will be to run the server on the same device of the client ( your
phone ), initially only for Android, iOS to check for feasibility.

My apologies for taking so long, but I'm still working and studying, it's
not easy to find the time for my passions, but I'm doing my best.

Don't ask for cSploit 2 ETA: it will be released as soon as possible! :sunglasses:
