##### Background

On 03-09-2014 someone stole my motorbike while I was studying in my campus.

##### My targets

  - purchase a new motorbike :ballot_box_with_check:
  - graduate

##### My efforts

Starting from March/April I said to all my friends that I will no more exit with them for have our usual fun.
I bought 2 Kg of rice at 2 â‚¬, eating just 100g of white rice per day.
I started working more, acquiring new clients and accepting a lot of works.

##### My wins

Around 24-04-2015 I bought a new motorbike.
I bought an used one, I don't like it so much.
But it's a motorbike, that's enought for now :blush:.

##### My school

I'm taking many courses to finish my lower-level graduation.
3 of these require to build a project.
for June I have to:

  - build a website
  - build a complex system for a big company
  - build a game in Java

beside these jobs I have the exams for other courses for July.

  - Physics
  - Technical Physics
  - Mechanics
  - Logic Circuits
  - Database 1
  - Geometry

##### My fails

I asked to my teachers if I can do the Java game alone, but they decided to not give me this possibility.
Instead they choose a guy from the heap and told me to work with him.
One thing that I love of the internet is that I can judge people by what they say and do,
choosing the right collaborators for my project.
My collabolator for the Java game doesn't have any programming skills, and ( for now ) isn't eager to learn.
That will cause me to work twice to achieve a good vote.

##### Unexpected things

Personally I thought I was a good Object-Oriented programmer. I was wrong.
The course of Sotware Engineering is improving a lot my OOP skills.

##### cSploit and Me

I love cSploit and the main targets that this app have.
I want to keep working on it. Making it better and with more features.
Sadly for the above reasons I havn't time to work on it right now.
I will resume working on it in a pair of months. Really As Soon As Possible :blush:.
