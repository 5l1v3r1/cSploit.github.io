## goodbye my friend

Today, while i was going to school by train, my T42 stop working.

I build it from a T42 and a T40 taken from the tip.
It's fan needed a boost for start, every time I need to turn it on I had to blow into the fan.
But it's keyboard was so comfortable... The trackpoit was so useful when coding in crowded places like trains.

## consequences

The impact of this event on the cSploit development it's huge.
I leave home at 6:00 AM and I come back from school around 7/8 PM.
Usually I study with a colleague from 9 PM to 11 PM.

The time I can spend on cSploit is now drastically reduced.

Another consequence is that I was using the T42 as wireless bridge between my LAN and my neighborhood WiFi ( without his agreement :grin: ). Now I have to use the limited bandwith of my mobile data plan.

## solutions
I can spend some time on trying to repair the T42, but this is the period for partial exams, I cannot do it right now.
Another solution is to buy an used thinkpad. But I have to work about a month for earn enought ( i 'm not working so much because I want to graduate this year ).
