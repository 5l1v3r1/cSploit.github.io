##### Hello
Hi guys, I am DeveloppSoft, one of the cSploit devs.
I am currently working on the version 2 of our great project :heart:!
Let me give you some news...

##### The new daemon
As some of you know, we have decided to rewrite the whole project in golang in order to build a daemon that will be able to run on most platforms (computers, Android phones, etc...). The daemon is located in a [new repository](https://github.com/cSploit/daemon), so you can track our progress!

##### But... What about the UI??
Well... That's a tricky question :smile:...
Currently we are focusing on the daemon, but we planned to start developing the UI soon!

##### How will it work?
We will use a web based UI (provide more portability accross the different platforms) that will communicate with the daemon thanks to a REST api.

##### What we did...
<ul class="collection">
  <li class="collection-item">A nice database</li>
  <li class="collection-item">Ability to manage hosts, ports, services and even scanned networks!</li>
  <li class="collection-item">Wifi cracking (no, it's not a joke :smirk:)</li>
  <li class="collection-item">Network radar</li>
</ul>

##### What's planed?
<ul class="collection">
  <li class="collection-item">I will work on implementing rogue APs (thanks to the [mana](https://github.com/sensepost/mana) project) and Wps attacks</li>
  <li class="collection-item">Tux-mind is working very hard on the daemon (can't quote everything :smile:!).
  <li class="collection-item">Napitek is working on evilproxy</li>
  <li class="collection-item">IwraStudios is working on dns2proxy</li>
 </li>
</ul>

##### The end
Well... I guess it is the end, thanks guys!
And... don't forget to make a donation to the project if you can! :heart:
