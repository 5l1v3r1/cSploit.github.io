You can contribute to cSploit by donating:
Incomings of donations will be used to buy hardware and services required by cSploit developers and network infrastructure.

Things to purchase:

  - An old used iPhone
  - A Build Server
  - An USB OTG adapter

we must also pay annual services like the csploit.org DNS record and more.

Thanks for your help! :heart:
